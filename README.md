  <br>
  Scientific initiation project carried out over a period of 2 and a half years, financed by the Foundation for Research Support of the State of S√£o Paulo (FAPESP) [#2019/01597-7], taught by <a href="https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/pesquisador/666459/kelton-augusto-pontara-da-costa">PhD Kelton Augusto Pontara da Costa</a> from S√£o Paulo State University (Unesp). <br>
  <br>
  The project was carried out in the following stages: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>choice of parameters used;<\li>
    <li>choice of machine learning techniques and database with malicious and non-malicious HTTPs requests, in addition to their manipulation;<\li>
    <li>application of techniques and measurement of accuracy;<\li>
    <li>choice and application of the techniques that formed the Ensemble;<\li>
    <li>choice and application of the CNN Neural Network (deep learning);<\li>
    <li>comparison between all the techniques used;<\li>
    <li>article writing;<\li>
  <\ul>
<br>
The entire project was written in <b>Python<\b> through <b>Google Colabs<\b> and using the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learning<\a> libraries.
